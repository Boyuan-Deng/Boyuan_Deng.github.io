                <div class="aboutTextMain">
                    <p>Ever since I was a kid, I wanted to help people. I was born with a cleft palate, so being faced
                        with
                        challenges from an early age, I found joy in helping others overcome theirs. I still remember my
                        elementary school friends coming to me for advice regarding their "love" life... heh.</p>

                    <p>Years later, I managed to get into the most prestigious higher-ed school in Serbia (my home
                        country), to
                        study psychology. I dreamed of becoming a therapist, but somewhere along the way, I discovered I
                        preferred the more logical, data-driven approach in the field of cognitive assessment. Being an
                        overachiever, I undertook the most difficult Master's Degree project I could find, and ended up
                        helping
                        to improve the state of cognitive assessment in Serbia.</p>

                    <p>Around this time, I started getting serious about design. I had made a few websites for friends
                        (in
                        tables!), and realized this was something I was actually good at. I moved half way across the
                        world, to
                        the U.S., and co-founded a design agency with my amazing wife.</p>

                    <p>Along the way, I learned to incorporate my empathy, passion, and skills I learned in psychology
                        into my
                        design work. I helped my clients identify and solve their core problems, and co-created
                        solutions that
                        improved their business, and the lives of their users.</p>

                    <p>Today, as I move away from remote contracting, I'm looking to find a company that is passionate
                        about
                        design&hairsp; and making the world a better place for everyone.</p>

                    <blockquote>Goran was B-Stock's first designer helping the company since its inception. I was always
                        impressed by his attention to detail, ability to offer us more than one solution and efficient
                        execution. I would recommend Goran to any modern Silicon Valley type outfit where effective
                        design is
                        important.

                    </blockquote>
                    <blockquote>I have worked with Goran for 7 years and he was a pleasure to work with. In addition to
                        his
                        great design skills, he is always learning and working to understand additional elements of his
                        craft
                        like ux design for multiple platforms. He takes ownership of his work and goes over and above
                        consistently.

                    </blockquote>
                    <blockquote>It was clear to me from the start that Goran had a keen eye for user experience. Goran
                        was
                        always willing to explore new concepts, and was very excited to push the boundaries and
                        challenge the
                        norms of what constitutes good design.
